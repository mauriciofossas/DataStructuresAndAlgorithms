# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms
A set of problems to explore data structures and algorithms. Problems are my own solutions to those posted in LeetCode (www.leetcode.com); explanation to all problems can be found in each individual class/file and test cases (JUnit tests) for all problems can be found in the DataStructuresTests.java class/file.
